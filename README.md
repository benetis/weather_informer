I am making this project for the purpose of getting familiar with Ruby and RoR. 
However, feel free to use it as you wish.

## Description
Simple weather forecast informer. Will send a notification if weather conditions are met.

- Call meteo.lt API to get weather data (Don't abuse their API, they have 20k daily limit. 24 requests per day should be more than enough)
  - Save data to database
- Run periodic worker which checks if data matches specified conditions
  - Ex: if it will rain today â€“ send a notification
    - Email
    - Telegram bot
- Telegram API to ask about current conditions or forecast

## Running
- Locally
  - `docker-compose up -d` for Redis & Sidekiq
  - Database is SQLite, so no need to run anything
  - `rails server`

## Configuration
- `EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit`
- ```yml
  emails_to_notify: ["email@to_deliver.local"] #where to deliver notifications
