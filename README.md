# README

## Disclaimer
I am making this project for the purpose of getting familiar with Ruby and RoR. 
However, feel free to use it as you wish.

## Running
- Locally
  - `docker-compose up -d` for Redis
  - Database is SQLite, so no need to run anything
  - `rails server`
  - `bundle exec sidekiq` for notifications
