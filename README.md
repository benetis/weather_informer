I am making this project for the purpose of getting familiar with Ruby and RoR.
However, feel free to use it as you wish.

## Description

Simple weather forecast informer. Will send a notification if weather conditions are met.

- Call meteo.lt API to get weather data (Don't abuse their API, they have 20k daily limit. 24 requests per day should be
  more than enough)
    - Save data to database
- Run periodic worker which checks if data matches specified conditions
    - Ex: if it will rain today â€“ send a notification
        - Email
        - Telegram bot
- Telegram API to ask about current conditions or forecast
    - `.` Will return a list of options to choose from. For ex: `Kada lis?`, which returns nearest rain forecast
